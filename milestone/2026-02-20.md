# Milestone: 2026-02-20 - Project Management Module Enhancements

## Overview
Today's work focused on significantly enhancing the Project Management module. This included comprehensive updates to both the backend APIs and frontend components to support more robust project creation, team management, and task linking, along with a refinement of the project creation form fields for better user experience.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Project Creation & Edit Optimization
-   **Simplified Form:** Removed "Start Date" and "End Date" fields from the project creation and edit modal UIs, making them optional on the backend.
-   **Main Entity Handling:** Removed the "Our Entity" (我方主体) selection field from the frontend UI entirely. The backend now automatically fetches and binds a default entity for new projects if one is not explicitly provided.
-   **Project Manager Selection:** Improved the project manager dropdown in both the creation and edit modals. It now pulls real user data from the IAM module and displays the employee's `display_name` instead of requiring manual input or showing internal IDs/emails.

### 2. Project Management Capabilities (Backend & Frontend)
-   **Project Members:** Implemented backend APIs for adding, removing, and listing project members (`ProjectMember`). Built the corresponding `ProjectTeam` frontend component to manage team roles within a project.
-   **Project Tasks:** Added API endpoints to retrieve associated To-Do items linked to a specific project. Implemented the `ProjectTasks` component on the frontend to display project-specific tasks.
-   **Project Deletion:** Added backend support for deleting projects.
-   **UI Integration:** Integrated the new team and task management components into the Project Detail page, providing a comprehensive view of project status, members, and related tasks.
