# Canvas Design Skill

This workflow uses the globally installed `canvas-design` skill at:
`C:\Users\YZ\.antigravity\skills\skills\skills\canvas-design`

Read the full skill instructions before proceeding:
```
C:\Users\YZ\.antigravity\skills\skills\skills\canvas-design\SKILL.md
```

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Creating visual design artifacts (posters, covers, infographics)
- Producing PDF or PNG design outputs
- Applying a specific design movement (Brutalism, Minimalism, Geometric Silence, etc.)

## Workflow

### 1. Read the Skill

```
view_file C:\Users\YZ\.antigravity\skills\skills\skills\canvas-design\SKILL.md
```

### 2. Define the Design Philosophy

Choose a design movement to anchor the work:
- **Minimalism**: Extreme whitespace, single focal point
- **Brutalism**: Raw, bold, unconventional layouts
- **Geometric Silence**: Shapes and negative space as communication
- **Editorial**: Magazine-style typography and layout

### 3. Plan the Composition

- Define canvas dimensions (A4, square, banner, etc.)
- Choose color palette (2-3 colors max for minimalist work)
- Select typography that matches the design movement

### 4. Implement

- Use Python (ReportLab, Pillow) or SVG for vector output
- Export as PDF or PNG
- Ensure high resolution (300 DPI for print)

### 5. Review

- Does the design communicate the intended message?
- Is the design movement executed with precision?
- Are proportions and spacing intentional?
