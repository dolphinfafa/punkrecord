## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Writing or co-authoring any document collaboratively
- Creating reports, proposals, memos, or long-form content
- Iteratively refining a document with user feedback

## Three-Stage Workflow

### Stage 1: Context Gathering

Ask clarifying questions to understand:
- **Purpose**: What is this document for? Who is the audience?
- **Tone**: Formal, casual, technical, persuasive?
- **Length**: How long should it be?
- **Key points**: What must be covered?
- **Constraints**: Any specific format, structure, or style requirements?

Avoid asking too many questions at once. Start with the most important ones.

### Stage 2: Refinement & Structure

1. Draft an outline for user approval
2. Write the document section by section
3. Incorporate user feedback iteratively
4. Refine language, flow, and structure

### Stage 3: Reader Testing

- Review the document as a fresh reader
- Check for clarity, coherence, and completeness
- Identify any gaps or confusing sections
- Make final polish edits

## Tips

- Always confirm the outline before writing full content
- Use the user's own words and terminology when possible
- Offer alternatives when the user seems unsatisfied with a section
